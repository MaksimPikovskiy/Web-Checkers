1. Run "mvn compile exec:java" in the root project directory
2. Open a browser to "localhost:4567"
    The current project has both regular games and AI games so try testing both types of games.
    There are two previous bugs that you should try to test for
        1. If challenge a player and at some point during the game, the player waiting for their opponent to make a move 
            resigns followed by the opponent resigning, then when the original challenger re-challenges the same opponent, 
            then the opponent will never be taken to the game page.
        2. Test the AI making a multi-jump with a king piece.
